# Snake

Snake is a well known game. It consists on moving the snake around the map, getting it to it more food and to grow longer. The longer you grow, the harder it gets.


## Try it out

2. Create an enviroment and then install the requirements using the requirements fille: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. the run the game by using `python main.py`

```python

a = np.random.rand(10)
```

### For Windows users
How to download and play the game?

1- You have to download the whole folder. To do this, click on the green button that have a "down arrow" + "code". After that, click on "Download ZIP".

2- Put the ZIP file that you have just downloaded in whatever folder in your computer you like.

3- Right click on the zip folder and choose the option "Extract here". It will generate a folder with the same name as the .ZIP file.

4- Once inside the folder, there will be 4 more ZIP files that you have to extract. Use the same method as before with the "extract here" button. Once the files are extracted, DELETE the ZIP files and stay with the folder ones.

VERY IMPORTANT: USE THE "EXTRACT HERE" BUTTON AND ONLY THAT ONE. IF NOT IT WILL GENERATE OVERLAPPING FOLDERS THAT MAY CAUSE ISSUES.

5- Once everything is done, doble-click on the .EXE file and the game should work just fine. ENJOY IT.

This is my second game, and it was more challenging that the other one I made in many ways.


## ERRORS & BUGS

It has one main error and one main bug. The error will not be specified here, find it out by yourself if you can. The bug occurs randomly and I can't figure out what triggers it. It's about the generation of the apples. Sometimes the function that creates the apples decides it's time to create more than 1 apple, so it creates two apples that keep spawning the rest of the game until you lose.

## INCOMING UPDATES

In the future maybe I will dow a score system and a three or four level of difficulty system.
