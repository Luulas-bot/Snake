# Snake
## About this game
This is the typcal game of *snake*, wich all of us know pretty well. I decided to implment a *main menu* and a *pause* function just to make things a little bit more complicated. The main reason I created the game was to continue developing my skills as a programmer. After being done with my previous project, I decided to go for something a little bit mor complex than a spaceship and some asteroids.

## What offers this game?
- Obviously, it offers the game it self.
- Peharps you are here looking more for the code to create your own snake, so that is also possible. Just go to `main.py` and there you have it.
- While doing the game I decided to not look at any video explaining how to do it or how the code should be written. I thought everthing by myself, and that ended up creating some particular mechanics that, I belive, are not the most conventional ones. If you wanna look at them...

## The language
I programmed everything in `python` because it's what i learned. I used `pygame` as a module to create the game, wich is a great module for games. 

## Can you download this program in your computer? (Not right now, soon this option will be aviable)
The answer is yes, you can. What you have to do is the following:
- First you gotta create an envoirment with all the requirments. You can find these in the `requirements.txt` file. If you have Python already installed in your computer, then forget about this step.
- Then, once the env is setted up, you have to download the scripts + the images. You can do this using the green button on the top right part, which says **code**.
- This will download you a `.zip` file which you have to drag into the folder where you created the env.
- Once that is done, you have to right-click the `.zip` file and extract everything from it.
- Then using your favorite IDE, enter into `main.py`, compile it and run it.

## Some things you perhaps wanna know
This is my second project all done by myself, so I know it's not written or created in the best way possible (spreading the code in different files, using a lot more classes, etc). Anyways I enjoyed doing it and I learned a lot of stuff that will surely show off in the next project.
All the graphical elements are also done by me using photoshop. If you don't wanna lose time in those things, just download the images from the repo.

# Enjoy!
