# Snake

Snake is a well known game. It consists on moving the snake around the map, getting it to it more food and to grow longer. The longer you grow, the harder it gets.

How to download and play the game?

1- You have to download the whole folder. To do this, click on the green button that have a "down arrow" + "code". After that, click on "Download ZIP".

2- Put the ZIP file that you have just downloaded in whatever folder in your computer you like.

3- Right click on the zip folder and choose the option "Extract here". It will generate a folder with the same name as the .ZIP file.

4- Once inside the folder, there will be 4 more ZIP files that you have to extract. Use the same method as before with the "extract here" button.

VERY IMPORTANT: USE THE "EXTRACT HERE" BUTTON AND ONLY THAT ONE. IF NOT IT WILL GENERATE OVERLAPPING FOLDERS THAT MAY CAUSE ISSUES.

5- Once everything is done, doble-click on the .EXE file and the game should work just fine. ENJOY IT.

This is my second game, and it was more challenging that the other one I made in many ways.

-------------------------------------------------------ERRORS------------------------------------------------------------------

It has two main errors that I have not figured out how to solve yet, but anyways I wanted to upload the game and, if the energy comes to me, eventually I will solve those errors.
One of these two doesn't really matter, the other one is more important. The error consists on the points (apples). These sometimes generates on the snake and not on the empty space. If you have a solution to this problem, contact me. Thank you
